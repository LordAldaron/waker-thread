//! Abstraction over OS APIs to handle asynchronous device waking.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//! Most devices are represented as file descriptors on unix-like operating
//! systems (MacOS also has run loops).  On Windows, devices are usually sockets
//! or handles.  WebAssembly running in the browser doesn't have a equivalent.
//! To get around these device backend differences, Smelling Salts exposed an
//! [`OsDevice`] type which has [`From`] conversions implemented for the
//! platform types.
//!
//! An [`OsDevice`] by itself isn't that useful, though.  When you have a handle
//! to a device, you want to asynchronously watch it for events.  For this, you
//! construct a [`Device`], which implements [`Notifier`](pasts::Notifier).
//! But, general devices aren't that useful either, so you'll need to wrap it
//! in your own custom type.  Usually, you will filter out some of the events,
//! so you'll need to implement [`Notifier`](pasts::Notifier).
//!
//! Here's a simple example implementing a [`Notifier`](pasts::Notifier) for
//! stdin line reading:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
#![cfg_attr(target_os = "linux", doc = include_str!("../examples/stdin.rs"))]
//! ```
